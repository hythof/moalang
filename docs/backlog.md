# Allowed
- exception: for unified error handling
- variadic arguments: for "print" or function wrapper
- optional: for user input

# Rejected
- number interface: "**" is not good match for some types, e.g, vector2

# Pending
- overload: it reduces readability, but IDE could mitigate?
- property: no consistency, but intuitiveness
- type level programming: flexible, but excessive
