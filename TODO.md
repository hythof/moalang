- Keep conceptual integrity based on minimal primitives
- Support both functional and imperative programming

# Do not
- Inheritance
- Avoid symbols like semi-corron, comma and parenthiese

# Todo
- [ ] Think new syntax for iif because its readability is not good

- [x] Interpriter (2/2)
- [ ] Compiler to JavaScript
- [ ] Compiler to native code
- [ ] HTTP server
- [ ] Relational database and KVS
- [ ] Reactive module for web browser
- [ ] Bidirectional remote procedure call

# Optimization
- [ ] Compiler to Go by interpriter
- [ ] Cross compile to Linux, Mac and Windows
- [ ] Debugger
- [ ] Profiler

# Pending
- [ ] Bcrypt
- Consider to add events type for UI

# Policy
- Main purpose of Moa language is that accelarate web development
