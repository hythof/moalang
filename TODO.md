# Do
- Minimize the number of elements in code to help understanding
- Keep conceptual integrity based on minimal primitives
- Support both functional and imperative programming

# Do not
- Inheritance

# Todo
- [ ] Interpriter
- [ ] Type inference
- [ ] Compiler to JavaScript
- [ ] Compiler to executable file via LLVM
- [ ] HTTP server
- [ ] Transactional database
- [ ] Debugger
- [ ] Reactive UI framework
- [ ] Bidirectional remote procedure call

# Optimization
- [ ] Compiler to Go by interpriter
- [ ] Cross compile to Linux, Mac and Windows
- [ ] Debugger
- [ ] Profiler

# Pending
- [ ] Create new syntax for name of capture variable in enum matching as ===
- [ ] Consider to split "guard" to "if" and "return"
- [ ] Bcrypt
- Consider to add events type for UI

# Policy
- Main purpose of Moa language is that accelarate web development
- Moa language consists core and library
- The core is pure, which does not provide any IO
- The library provides IO via its interface
